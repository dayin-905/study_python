# Directory Overview

This directory contains a series of Python tutorials covering fundamental concepts. The files are a mix of Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) and Python scripts (`.py`), suggesting a hands-on learning approach. The content progresses from basic data types like strings, lists, and dictionaries to control flow structures like `if` statements and `while` loops.

## Key Files

*   **`01_variables_string.ipynb`**: Introduces string variables and basic string operations.
*   **`02_variables_list.ipynb`**: Covers Python lists, including creation and manipulation.
*   **`03_variables_dict.ipynb`**: Explains Python dictionaries (key-value pairs).
*   **`04_variables_bundles.ipynb`** and **`04_variables_bundles_more`**: Demonstrate how to work with more complex data structures, likely lists of dictionaries.
*   **`05_ifs.py`**: Provides examples of conditional `if` statements.
*   **`06_whiles.py`**: Shows how to use `while` loops for iteration. This file was recently updated to fix a `TypeError` related to string and integer concatenation in the print statement.

## Usage

This directory is intended for self-paced learning of Python. Users can follow the numbered files to progress through the topics. The Jupyter notebooks can be run interactively to experiment with the code, while the Python scripts can be executed directly.
